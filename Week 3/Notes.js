// State Derived Frontends 
// 1. State -> The `Variable` parts of the app
// 2. Components -> How to `Render` `State` on the screen
// 3. Rendering -> Taking the `State` and Rendering it on the screen based on the `Componenets`

// on linkedin -> the post "wireframe" is the component -> profile picture, subtext, image, time posted ago...
//             -> the state is what content is inside the post, picture, etc etc that gets dynamically changed based on each post, but the wireframe (component) remains the same
// think of state like a js object: { title: "___", profilePicutre: "asfd.png", postedAgo: "psdfasdf", likeCount: 1000}
